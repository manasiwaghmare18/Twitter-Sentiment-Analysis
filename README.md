# About Dataset
Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset

# Overview
This is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.

# In conclusion, the sentiment analysis provides valuable insights into the prevailing attitudes and opinions within the Twitter community regarding various topics. While negative sentiments appear to be more common overall, there is a diverse range of sentiments expressed across different topics.
